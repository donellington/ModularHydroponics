# Realm React Native Tutorial

Follow along at https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/tutorial/react-native/

## Troubleshooting

The most common issue is schema mismatch due to frequent little tweaks to the
schema as you develop your app.

- Be sure to **check the logs in Realm UI** for more information as well as the console in your app.
- **Delete the app from the simulator** to purge local data.
- **Restart Sync** in the Realm UI by clicking "Delete Synced Data" on the Sync page.
- Be sure to **deploy your changes** in the Realm UI.
- If your schema does not match the server, **compare the class definitions from the SDKs tab in the Realm UI** with those in the client code.
- When creating objects, make sure the **partition value of your new object matches** the partition value you opened the Realm with.

# mern-auth

![Final App](https://i.postimg.cc/tybZb8dL/final-MERNAuth.gif)
Minimal full-stack MERN app with authentication using passport and JWTs.

This project uses the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org) and [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) for frontend
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the backend
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the database
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/basics/usagewithreact) for state management between React components

## Configuration

Make sure to add your own `MONGOURI` from your [mLab](http://mlab.com) database in `config/keys.js`.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  mongoURI: "YOUR_MONGO_URI_HERE",
  secretOrKey: "secret"
};
```

## Quick Start

```javascript
// Install dependencies for server & client
npm install && npm run client-install

// Run client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

// Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```
